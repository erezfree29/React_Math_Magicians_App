      A mathemagician is a mathematician who is also a magician. The term
      &quot;mathemagic&quot;  is believed to have been introduced by Royal Vale
      Heath with his 1933 book
      &quot;Mathemagic&quot;.[1]
      <span className="name">
        The name &quot;mathemagician&quot; was probably first applied to Martin
        Gardner, but has since been used to describe many mathematician/magicians,
        ncluding Arthur T. Benjamin,[2] Persi Diaconis,[3] and Colm Mulcahy.[4] Diaconis
        has suggested that the reason so many mathematicians are magicians is
        that &quot;inventing a magic trick and inventing a theorem are very similar
        activities.&quot;[5]
